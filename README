Puppet DNS module

This is a set of two types and providers to manage hosted DNS systems.
This is done with the help of the ruby library Fog, so it can manage AWS Route %#, Zerigo 
and other DNS hosters.

Usage

dnszone {
    "planetpuppet.org":
        ensure => present,
        email => "brice@daysofwonder.com",
        yaml_fog_file => "./fog.yaml"
}

dnsrr {
    "www.planetpuppet.org":
        type => "A",
        value => "2.4.6.9",
        ensure => present
}

The fog.yaml file contains the fog provider and credentials as in this Route 53
examples:

fog.yaml:
---
  provider: aws
  aws_access_key_id: ...
  aws_secret_access_key: ...
